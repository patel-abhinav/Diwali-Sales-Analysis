# Diwali-Sales-Analysis
This project employs **Python** for analysing Diwali sales data, focusing on enhancing customer experience and optimizing inventory. Data cleaning and manipulation were executed using **Pandas**, while **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** was performed with **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. The analysis identified key customer demographics and top-selling products, enabling targeted marketing and efficient inventory planning. Insights derived from the data help in forecasting demand, ensuring adequate stock for high-demand items, and ultimately improving sales performance and customer satisfaction during the Diwali season. This project underscores the value of data-driven strategies in optimizing business operations and enhancing customer engagement.
